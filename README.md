# ngCharts

This is a ltest project to demonstrate my frontend skills. Project is based on Angular and uses next libraries:
* rxjs,
* lodash,
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/),
* [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/),
* [Elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/) as a state manager

This project uses local [demo API server](https://github.com/ingmartin/demoChartsAPI.py). Use docker-compose to run this server.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.4.
